The Cake Issues addins are built in a modular architecture, allowing to easily
enhance it for supporting additional analyzers, linters, report formats and code review systems.

The core consists of the following addins:

| Addin                    | Description                                                            |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cake.Issues              | Provides aliases for reading issues using one or more issue providers. |
| Cake.Issues.Reporting    | Provides aliases for creating reports for issues.                      |
| Cake.Issues.PullRequests | Provides aliases for reporting issues as comments to pull requests.    |

Support for different code analyzers and linters can be provided through additional [issue provider] addins.
